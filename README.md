# AIOFlipper

Full open source version of my RuneScape Companion webclient bot. Was running with 25 accounts, averaging around 250M in game currency profit each day (7.5B/month).
This project highly relies on selenium and couchDB.

Project is still in a working state but I discontinued running it since the game is economically dying.
